Hello people, this is my EXAMPLE branch. Don't change it, don't do anything to it.

This is an example to show you how to create a new branch. In the new branch, you can change things however you like, without damaging the main branch at all. Name your branch like "NAME - PURPOSE - FOLDERS_ALTERED".

Above is an demonstration to where to create branches.

Good luck coding, nerds.

Best wishes,
